                    <h2>01 Amer Fort</h2>
                </b>
                <p>Amer, or Amber, derives its name from the Ambikeshwar Temple, built atop the Cheel ka Teela.
                    Ambikashwara is a local name for the god Shiva. However, local folklore suggests that the fort
                    derives its name from Amba, the Mother Goddess Durga.
                    Amer Fort or Amber Fort is a fort located in Amer, Rajasthan, India. Amer is a town with an area of
                    4 square kilometres (1.5 sq mi).
                    located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. Located high on a hill, it is
                    the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur.Amer Fort is known for its artistic style elements. With
                    its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks Maota Lake,
                    which is the main source of water for the Amer Palace.Amer Palace is great example of Rajput
                    architecture. Some of its buildings and work have influence of Mughal architecture.
                    Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels,
                    each with a courtyard.
                    The Palace is divided into six separate but main sections each with its own entry gate and
                    courtyard. The main entry is through the Suraj Pol (Sun Gate) which leads to the first main
                    courtyard. This was the place where armies would hold victory parades with their war bounty on their
                    return from battles, which were also witnessed by the Royal family's womenfolk through the latticed
                    windows.
                    This gate was built exclusively and was provided with guards as it was the main entry into the
                    palace. It faced east towards the rising sun, hence the name. Royal cavalcades and dignitaries
                    entered the palace through this gate.
                    aleb Chowk is an Arabic phrase meaning a place for soldiers to assemble. This is one of the four
                    courtyards of Amer Palace, which was built during Sawai Jai Singh's reign (1693–1743 AD). Maharaja's
                    personal bodyguards held parades here under the command of the army commander or Fauj Bakshi. The
                    Maharaja used to inspect the guards contingent. Adjacent to the courtyard were the horse stables,
                    with the upper-level rooms occupied by the guards.
                    Amer Fort is a fort cum palace that greets you with warm Rajasthani folk music and mesmerizes you
                    with its beauty. Precision of carvings and embedment of stones prove that it is a finely-crafted
                    marvel. Being perched on a hillock of Aravali Range, Amer Fort has been regarded as a UNESCO World
                    Heritage Site along with other hill forts of Rajasthan.

                <h2>Mehrangarh Fort</h2>
                <p>
                    Mehrangarh Fort covers an area of 1,200 acres (486 hectares) in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. The
                    complex is located on a hilltop around 122 metres above the surrounding plain,
                    and was constructed c. 1459 by Rajput ruler Rao Jodha, though most of the existing structure is from
                    the 17th century. Inside its boundaries there are several palaces known for their intricate carvings
                    and expansive courtyards, as well as a museum housing various relics. A winding road leads to and
                    from the city below. The imprints of the impact of cannonballs fired by attacking armies of Jaipur
                    can still be seen on the second gate. At the north-east of the fort is the chhatri of Kirat Singh
                    Soda, a soldier who fell on the spot defending Mehrangarh.

                    There are seven gates, which include Jai Pol (meaning 'victory gate'), built by Maharaja Man Singh
                    to commemorate his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806. The Fattehpol (also meaning
                    'victory gate'), commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals.

                    Some of the notable festivals taking place here include the World Sacred Spirit Festival and
                    Rajasthan International Folk Festival.
                    Mehrangarh (etymology: 'Mihir' (Sanskrit) -sun or Sun-deity; 'garh' (Sanskrit)-fort;
                    i.e.'Sun-fort'); according to Rajasthani language pronunciation conventions, 'Mihirgarh' has changed
                    to 'Mehrangarh'; the Sun-deity has been the chief deity of the Rathore dynasty.
                    Though the fortress was originally started in 1459 by Rao Jodha, founder of Jodhpur, most of the
                    fort which stands today dates from the period of Maharaja Jaswant Singh (1638–78). The fort is
                    located at the centre of the city spreading over 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) on top of a high hill. Its
                    walls, which are up to 36 metres (118 ft) high and 21 metres (69 ft) wide, protect some of the most
                    beautiful and historic palaces in Rajasthan. Khandwaliya community one of the old traditional
                    community had the knowledge of breaking the big stones made this fort with others.
                    Entry to the fort is gained through a series of seven gates. The most famous of the gates are:
                    <br>
                    Jai Pol ("Gate of Victory"), built by Maharaja Man Singh in 1806 to celebrate his victory in a war
                    with Jaipur and Bikaner.<br>
                    Fateh Pol, built to celebrate a victory over the Mughals in 1707;<br>
                    Gopal Pol, it is the second Pol after Fateh Pol.<br>
                    Dedh Kangra Pol, which still bears the scars of bombardment by cannonballs;<br>
                    Amruti Pol, it is in between Dedh Kangra Pol and Loha Pol.<br>
                    Loha Pol, which is the final gate into the main part of the fort complex. Immediately to the left
                    are the handprints (sati marks) of the ranis and some princesses, who had committed Sati over the
                    years after death of their husband.<br>
                    Suraj Pol, inner most gate which provides access to palace complex and Daulat Khana Chauk.<br>

                    Overlooking the Blue City of Jodhpur from a height from 125 meters, Mehrangarh Fort was commissioned
                    back in 1460 by Rao Jodha. This rigid yet fascinating structure has been featured in many movies,
                    like The Dark Knight Rises and Awarapan. The fort has many palaces that flaunt immaculate carving
                    and the signature interiors of the regal Rajasthan in the past.

                <h2>Jaisalmer Fort</h2>
                <p>Rajasthan has a wide range of climate that varies from extremely arid to humid. The humid zone spans
                    the
                    southeast and east. Except in the hills, the heat during the summer is intense everywhere, with
                    temperatures
                    in June—the warmest month—typically rising from the mid-80s F (about 30 °C) to nearly 110 °F (low
                    40s C) daily.
                    Hot winds and dust storms occur in the summer, especially in the desert tract. In January—the
                    coolest of the
                    winter months—daily maximum temperatures range from the upper 60s to the mid-70s F (low to mid-20s
                    C),
                    while minimum temperatures are generally in the mid-40s F (about 7 °C). The western desert has
                    little rain,
                    averaging about 4 inches (100 mm) annually. In the southeast, however, some areas may receive almost
                    20 inches
                    (500 mm). Southeastern Rajasthan benefits from both the Arabian
                    Sea and Bay of Bengal branches of the southwest (summer) monsoon winds, which bring the bulk of the
                    annual
                    rainfall.</p>

                <h2>Plant and animal life</h2>
                <p>The predominant vegetation of Rajasthan is scrub jungle. Toward the west there are typical arid-zone
                    plants, such as tamarisk (genus Tamarix) and false tamarisk (genus Myricaria). Trees are scarce,
                    limited mostly to small, scattered forest areas in the Aravallis and in the eastern part of the
                    state. Less than 10 percent of Rajasthan is under forest cover.

                    A number of notable large mammals are regular residents of Rajasthan. Tigers are found primarily in
                    the Aravallis. Leopards, sloth bears, Indian sambar (dark brown Indian deer), and chital (spotted
                    deer) occur in the hills and forests. Nilgais (bluebucks; large antelope) are also found in parts,
                    and blackbucks are numerous in the plains. Common birds include snipes, quail, partridges, and wild
                    ducks; they occur everywhere except in the desert. The northwestern part of the state is well known
                    for several species of sandgrouse.

                    Numerous sanctuaries and wildlife parks have been established in the state. Among the most important
                    of those are Sariska National Park (established 1955), near Alwar in the northeast; Desert National
                    Park (1980), near Jaisalmer in western Rajasthan; and Keoladeo Ghana National Park (1981), in the
                    eastern part of the state near Bharatpur—the latter designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985

                    People of Rajasthan
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Most of Rajasthan’s population consists of Indians of various social, occupational, and religious
                    backgrounds. The Rajputs (various clans of landowning rulers and their descendants), though
                    representing only a small percentage of Rajasthan’s residents, are perhaps the most-notable section
                    of the population; indeed, the state draws its name from that community. In terms of caste
                    structure, the Brahmans (highest caste) are subdivided into many gotras (lineages), while the
                    Mahajans (trading caste) are subdivided into a bewildering number of groups. In the north and west
                    the Jats (peasant caste) and Gujars (herding caste) are among the largest agricultural communities.
                    Aboriginal (tribal) peoples constitute more than one-tenth of the population of Rajasthan. In the
                    eastern part of the state, those groups include the Mina (and the related Meo), most of whom are
                    farmers; the Banjara, who have been known as traveling traders and artisans; and the Gadia Lohar,
                    another historically itinerant tribe, who traditionally have made and repaired agricultural and
                    household implements. The Bhil, one of the oldest communities in India, generally inhabit southern
                    Rajasthan and have a history of possessing great skill in archery. The Grasia and Kathodi also
                    largely live in the south, mostly in the Mewar region.
                    Sahariya communities are found in the southeast, and the Rabari, who traditionally are cattle
                    breeders, live to the west of the Aravallis in west-central Rajasthan.

                    Hindi is the official language of the state, and to some degree it has overshadowed the local
                    languages of Rajasthan. Much of the state’s population, however, continues to speak Rajasthani
                    languages, which comprise a group of Indo-Aryan languages and dialects derived from Dingal, a tongue
                    in which bards once sang of the glories of their masters. The four main Rajasthani language groups
                    are Marwari in western Rajasthan, Jaipuri or Dhundhari in the east and southeast, Malvi in the
                    southeast, and in the northeast Mewati, which shades off into Braj Bhasa (a Hindi dialect) toward
                    the border with Uttar Pradesh.
                    Hinduism, the religion of the vast majority of the population, is generally practiced through the
                    worship of Brahma, Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, and other deities. The town of Nathdwara, in southern
                    Rajasthan, is an important religious centre for the Vallabhacharya school of Krishna worshippers.
                    There are also followers of Arya Samaj, a type of reformed Hinduism that stems from the late 19th
                    century.

                <h2>Economy</h2>
                <p>The agricultural sector has long been the mainstay of Rajasthan’s economy. It accounts for about
                    one-fourth of the state’s economic output, employing about two-thirds of the state’s working
                    population. Despite scant and scattered rainfall, nearly all types of crops are grown, including
                    pearl millet in the desert area, sorghum around Kota, and mainly corn (maize) around Udaipur. Wheat
                    and barley are fairly well distributed (except in the desert area), as are pulses (such as peas,
                    beans, and lentils), sugarcane, and oilseeds. Rice is grown in the irrigated areas of both the
                    southeast and the northwest. Cotton and tobacco are important cash crops. Rajasthan has a large
                    livestock
                    population and is a major wool-producing state. It also is a source of camels and draft animals of
                    various breeds.
                    <br> Rajasthan is an important producer of lead and zinc concentrates, emeralds, and garnets. A
                    major portion of the country’s gypsum and silver ore also are produced in Rajasthan. Electricity
                    supplies are obtained mostly from neighbouring states and from the Chambal Valley project. Power is
                    generated primarily from hydroelectric stations and gas-fired thermal plants. The state also draws a
                    portion of its energy from wind farms and from a nuclear power plant at Rawatbhata, southwest of
                    Kota.
                    Textiles, vegetable oil, wool, minerals, cement, and chemicals are among the major manufactures of
                    Rajasthan. However, handicrafts—such as leather goods, marble work, jewelry, pottery, and embossed
                    brass—have earned much foreign exchange. Kota, which is the industrial capital of the state, has a
                    nylon factory and a precision-instruments factory as well as plants for the manufacture of calcium
                    carbide, caustic soda, and rayon tire cord. There is a zinc-smelter plant near Udaipur.
                    <br>The service sector has grown substantially in importance since the late 20th century to
                    constitute about half the value of the state’s economy. Notable has been the increase in tourism,
                    visitors being drawn by Rajasthan’s large number of historical sites and natural areas.
                    The ancient Rajputana culture of Rajasthan remains engraved in the comparatively modern lifestyle of
                    people. Great dynasties like those of the Rajput and the Marathas have contributed to the diverse
                    and rich history of the state. The vast expanse of deserts, olden forts and palaces, and vibrant
                    arts, all represent the culture of Rajasthan.

                    pagari is usually 82 inches long and 8 inches wide. A Safa is shorter and broader. Ordinarily a
                    turban of a single colour is worn. However, turbans of one of more colours may be worn by the elite
                    or during special occasions such as festivals or weddings, etc. Rajasthani turbans are a prominent
                    tourist attraction. Tourists are often encouraged to participate in turban-tying competitions.

                    Inaugurated by the Bhil tribe and then adopted by royal clans, including the Rajputs, women perform
                    this dance form during festivals and important events like Holi, Teej and the arrival of a newlywed
                    wife in the home she married into. The women wear traditional costumes, ghagra (a long, flowing
                    skirt) and kanchli or choli (a blouse). To complete the costume, the face is covered by an odhani (a
                    veil). The charm of the folk genre is its beautiful gestures involving swinging hands, clapping and
                    twisting while singing traditional musical tunes. Together with a high pace and music, the
                    coordinated movements between dancers and their whirlwind dresses are fascinating and delightful. In
                    regions like Udaipur, Kota, Bundi and Jodhpur it is extremely popular. You will also often be
                    prompted to join in the dance with the locals.</p>

                <h2>2. Kachhi Ghodi Dance</h2>
                <p>Kachhi Ghodi is a renowned traditional dance performed by males from the Rajasthan district of
                    Shekhawati. Tales of local bandits executed via mock sword wars are told in the dance. Men wear
                    diverse traditional costumes such as a dhoti, turbans and kurtas, and they pretend to ride an
                    adorned dummy horse. The whole dance is meant to be a symbolic exhibition of chivalry and valour.
                    Dancers generally fake battles with swords to enhance the rhythm, while flute music and drums are
                    played in the background as accompaniment. You can find this type of dance form notably in the
                    Shekhawati region and in Jaipur and Udaipur, with it usually being performed during marriages or
                    social functions.</p>

                <p>The traditional dance Kalbelia (or Kalbeliya), the Rajasthan dance, is often referred to as “Sapera
                    Dance” or the “Snake Charmer Dance.” This dance was originated by the tribes of Kalbelia. It is a
                    lovely form of folk dance where women wear an angrakhi- a jacket-like garment, odhani- a veil, and a
                    black whirling ghagra- long skirt. They dance gracefully in groups curling around each other to
                    imitate a snake’s movement. The music played in these dances are by men by utilising traditional
                    instruments including the Dholak (a two-headed drum), the Khanjari (percussion instrument), and the
                    Pungi (a woodwind instrument). Other traditional musical instruments, such as dufli, morchang and
                    khuralio, are also available. The songs are based on folklore and mythological stories. The greatest
                    sites to enjoy this kind of dance are Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Barmer, Jalore, Jaipur, and

                <h2>4. Bhavai Dance</h2>
                <p>Rajasthan is mainly a traditional folk dance performed by ladies of the State Tribal Communities of
                    Kalbelia, Jat, Meena, Bhil or Kumhar. It takes many years that the dance takes ladies who balance
                    8-9 pots or brass pitchers on the head while dancing and twisting on the side of a glass or brass
                    plate with their feet (sometimes even the edge of a sword). The graciously twisting movements of
                    ladies paired with the balancing show their difficulties in society. The dance form is paired with
                    male singers and instruments like the harmonium, sarangi and dholak. During significant occasions
                    and festivals, experts perform this dance genre. Since some respected hotels provide a closer
                    insight into Rajasthan’s cultural and historical customs with these performances, visitors may
                    expect a feisty and exciting performance during their visit to the State. Apart from that Jodhpur,
                    Jaipur and Bikaner present some of the best shows of Bhavai.</p>

                <p>Gair is another of Rajasthan’s well-known folk dances from the Bhil community. This popular kind of
                    dancing has two types or variants which go by the name of Dandi Gair and Geendad. Men and women both
                    dance together, with appealing moves and colourful instruments. The men wear a long tunic-like skirt
                    with a staff, sword, and arrow, while the women wear ghagracholi. The music to this genre of dance
                    is performed on different traditional instruments, while dancers swing their arms to loud drums in a
                    clock-wise and anticlockwise way. At each turn the dancers fall in, beat their stick, while the song
                    is accompanied by a repetitive rhythmic thump of the drums. In the Mewar region, this dance type is
                    performed. However, its varieties such as the Dandi Gair and the Geendad also exist in Marwar and
                    Shekhawati.</p>

                <p>Kathputli is a famous puppet dance display that began in the Bhat tribal group of Rajasthan a
                    thousand years ago; and was named after Kath, which means “wood” and putli translates to “doll with
                    no life.” Kathputli are normally mango wood and cotton-stuffed. These dolls are usually 1/2 feet
                    high and constructed in Sawai-Madhopur, Bari and Udaipur. The puppets are controlled and manoeuvred
                    by strings on the limbs of the puppeteers. These people are also vocalists who give a special
                    flavour to Kathputli dancing as they sing stories from Indian culture and mythology. Some of them
                    also deal with current social challenges. Shadipur depot in New Delhi is the Kathputli Colony
                    neighbourhood, where these puppeteers have been living over the years. The two leading institutes in
                    the field of art preserve and promote the art of kathputli are Bhartiya Lok Kala Mandal in Udaipur,
                    established by Devilal Samar in 1952 and Rupayan Sansthan in Jodhpur, established by Vijaydan Detha
                    and Komal Kothari in 1960. The ideal spot to experience this popular Rajasthan dance is in the
                    Marwar region.</p>

                <p>Chari is a traditional type of folk dance hailing from the Saini communities of Ajmer and Kishagarh,
                    the Gujjar. Women perform at major events such as marriages, festivals. These women have traditional
                    dancing attire with a lot of ornaments incorporated in the costume. They balance brass pots (chari)
                    with a light lamp inside their heads ( which is set on fire with cotton seeds soaked in oil) while
                    also performing various tricks easily. The nagada, dholak and harmonium act as musical
                    accompaniments. The music and colour of the dance contrasts with this region’s dull and dry climate.
                    It brings enjoyment and vibrant energy to the people wactching it. Catch a glimpse of this dance

                <h2>8. Chakri Dance</h2>
                <p>The word “Chakri” denotes a circle, as the name implies. It is a popular folk dance of Kanjar in
                    several parts of Kota and Rajasthan district. It is usually done in groups of women. The dance shows
                    the circular movement of dancers on their knees, who twist in circles. Dancers wear beautiful skirts
                    with tons of traditional Rajasthani mirror work and the entire group looks radiant and colourful as
                    they carry out the dance. The Chakri draws its name from Chakra which means the wheel, and it goes
                    to indicate how quickly women move about when they spin like swift wheels. They cover a wide space
                    as they continue to move without clashing with each other and still move around the group with much
                    expertise. The music is quite important here because the dance is so rapid and agile. The women also
                    sing when they dance to support the quick rhythm of the instruments. The music begins gently and
                    continues to reach the height with the development of the dance. Nagara and the dholak are two major
                    instruments played as accompaniments to the dance of Chakri. The Nagara is an instrument like a
                    drum, and the beats are hard and loud, and they are the best music to play at a high level of energy
                    for the performance. Dholak is another drum-like instrument, producing wonderful and lively music as
                    well. Men play the Dholak or Nagara in most cases to support the women of their clans.</p>

                <p>It is truly rightly said that “One cannot think well, love well, sleep well if one has not dined
                    well.” The myriad cuisines found in India are simply immaculate and one that specifically stands out
                    remains the cuisine of the state of Rajasthan. The state is known for its snacks that we enjoy every
                    evening with the Lushun ki chutney, which is yet another gift given to us by this great state. Apart
                    from that, the intense appetizers, spicy dishes, and sabzis as well as how can one forget my
                    favorite part of the meal that is desserts, will surely get you drooling. Rajasthani dishes are the
                    red chilies that are added to avoid the loss of water but enhance the taste anyway. Here is a list
                    of the mouth-watering food of Rajasthan that you simply have to try when visiting the state.</p>

                <h2>1. Laal Maas</h2>
                <p>A discourse to Rajasthan is simply incomplete without Rajasthan’s very own, Laal Maas. This
                    traditional meat curry is made using varied ingredients such as of course, meat, in a thick gravy of
                    yogurt and countless spices but to give it its signature spicy element are the Mathania red chilies.
                    It is typically served along with bajra rotis and is a crown jewel of the Rajasthani Cuisine. Its
                    brilliance is derived from its bright red color that simply catches your attention towards this
                    must-try dish.</p>

                    ki Subzi. There isn’t a single Rajasthani thali that is served without this delicacy. The
                    preparation varies from region to regions such as the aromatic Masala Gatte and Shai Gatte, which is
                    aptly named, to say the least. The Gatte which are ground flour dumplings, taste scrumptious in the
                    hot gravy which is composed of mainly yogurt, and of course, it wouldn’t be a Rajasthani dish,
                    without adding in a complete variety of spices.</p>

                    are nothing if not a match made in heaven for they combine to form a delectable authentic Rajasthani
                    delicacy and this is a sabzi that everyone must simply try once in their life. It goes amazingly
                    with bajre ki roti, another specialty of the state, and the cherry on top, in this case, would be
                    the delightful butter on top. This dish is known for its spice but it also provides a tangy flavor
                    due to the addition of raisins to the recipe, guaranteed to make its taste unforgettable.</p>

                    household and is considered mainly three varieties: plain, mawa, and malai.</p>

                <p>Rajasthan is the heaven of cultural and traditional mingles. Textile is one of those cultural
                    entities that make Rajasthan stand out and shine among others. The state has a multitude of local
                    textile styles.

                    There is not one but many regional fabric styles spread across the state. India’s textile industry
                    is one of the largest and the oldest industries in India. The traces of textile weaving were found
                    in Vedic texts and archaeological finds from the Harappan civilization.

                    The Rajasthani fabrics industry uses cotton, silk, and wool as the fabric canvas to produce and
                    design the marvellous fabric styles. The Rajasthani textile got the ‘Heartland of Hand Block
                    Printing’ title.

                <h2>1. Bandhini Fabric </h2>
                <p>The Rajasthani precise design cloth work is famous in the whole world. The Bandhini textile is famous
                    for such work. Historical records suggest that the earliest examples of Bandhani date back to 4000
                    BCE. The Bandhani textile got its name because of the knots (Bandhan) on the cloth during dying. The
                    weavers intentionally leave the knot even after dying the fabric, which has become a Bandhani
                    Textile symbol.

                    This print is in practice in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh as well. This fine textile work is in demand
                    in the entire country. The designs include red, yellow, saffron, maroon, and black motifs.
                    The symbolism attached to this is multitude and goes hand in hand with the colour depiction. For
                    instance, a red cloth designed with Bandhani printing increases the beauty of a Hindu Bride. Another
                    example might be the representation of maternity via yellow Bandhani cloth.

                    Chandrakala, BavanBaug and Shikari are some of the patterns on the Bandhani fabric. The Khatri
                    community is the parent community that is responsible for the development of the Bandhani style.

                <p>The term ‘Leheriya’ derives its origin from the work ‘Leher’, meaning wave. The name accurately
                    describes the textile. The Leheriya work focuses on clear and sober pattern designs created on thin
                    cotton or silk cloth. This is predominantly famous for turbans, saris, and chunnis.

                    The Leheria turbans were a fashion statement in the 19th-20th centuries. Every one out of five men
                    in India wore a Leheria turban to show off their fashion sense. The Leheria textile industry got
                    fame for its zig-zag patterns and vibrant colour palette. The print is still in practice in
                    Nathwada, Jaipur, Udaipur, and Jodhpur.

                <h2>3. Bagru Fabric</h2>
                <p>The artists who work on the Bagru textile focus more on floral design printing, and they use natural
                    vegetable colours for printing. The Chippa community of Rajasthan extensively practises the Bagru
                    print.

                    The Bagra print originally belongs to the textile industry of Gujarat. It travelled with the chippa
                    community when they migrated to the deserts of Rajasthan from the Gujarati mainlands in the 17th
                    century. The weavers work on Indigo or blue-coloured cloth stylization to enhance the beauty of the
                    product.

                    Seyali Bagru is a type of Bagru print that involves the provocative use of yellow ochre and black
                    hues.

                <h2>4. Kota Doria Fabric </h2>
                <p>Kota Doria, as the name suggests, is a textile industry based in Kota. The checkered square patterns
                    are the speciality of the Kota Doria Cloth. The pure cotton or silk fabric is extremely lightweight,
                    and the use of check patterns is a unique lucrative method.

                    The style has roots in the textile style of Mysore. A Mughal army general, Rao Kishore, enlisted and
                    brought some weavers from Mysore, and this became the beginning of the style in Rajasthan. For this
                    reason, Kota Doria was called Kota Masuria in its initial days. The weavers often apply a mixture of
                    onion juice and rice paste while weaving the cloth, and the application of this mixture ensures
                    cloth durability.

                    Kaithloon, present near Kota, is insanely famous for Kota Doria sarees. Although machines are in
                    predominant use today, small handloom weavers got employment due to this textile industry. Not to
                    mention, the emotional strings attached to the handmade Kota Doria is absent in the machine-made
                    sarees.

                <h2>5. Barmeri Prints </h2>
                <p>The geometric prints of the cloth make the Barmeri textile unique. The Barmeri has to offer a lot
                    that does not resemble the typical Rajasthani textile. For instance, unlike the light floral colours
                    used in most textile works, Barmeri is famous for its dark shades. Based in the Thar desert, the
                    locals prefer darker colour tones as dark shades are cooler.

                    This famous textile of Rajasthan belongs to the Sindh region, and these prints originally belong to
                    the Sindhi Muslims. However, the art spread across the country along with cultural and trend shifts.

                    The Barmeri print often dwells on topics or themes like plants, animals, birds, and nature. The
                    bright and vibrant dyes used involve primary colours like red, yellow, indigo, etc.

                <h2>6. Sanganeri Fabric </h2>
                <p>Sangneri is one of the most famous textiles in Rajasthan. ‘A hub of block and screen printing in
                    Rajasthan’ is what we call it. The illustrious folk patterns on the white cotton give it a
                    traditional essence. Sangneri is famous for making tablecloths, home linens, bed covers, etc. The
                    folk motifs printed on the cloth also have black outlines which enhance the beauty of the fabric.
                    Figures and flower patterns use red dye to attract customers.

                    The Sangneri bloomed with the British invasion of India, and the European settlers exported large
                    quantities of Sangneri to Europe. Sangner in the pink city, Jaipur, is the originator of the style.
                    Wooden block printing is the core method in use, and Calico printing is the other name by which we
                    often call the Sanganeri block prints.

                    The most famous motifs include that of lotus flower, roses, sunflower, lily, etc. The initial
                    weavers used natural dyes only. However, chemical colours or dyes are no surprise wing to the stark
                    rise in demand and less staff.

                <p>An interesting fact about the Mothara Print- the Mothara print got its name from the Moth Dal. The
                    mothara print is an ever-flourishing tie and dye technique of Rajasthan with checkered patterns
                    printed on the cloth with interspersed undyed areas.

                    Rajasthan is among the best places to visit in the entire world. The earthly yet world-class
                    cultural embellishments are exclusive to Rajasthan. As a traveller, it is virtually impossible to
                    ‘keep your hands to yourself’ when you see alluring textile and handlooms everywhere you go. The
                    modern-day textile industry mainly relies on machines. However, the actual textile of Rajasthan lies
                    preserved in the handmade textile only. Although the hands of the weaver tremble, the essence and
                    beauty of the fabric are still intact.

                    of paintings that have originated from the state. Let’s explore some of the popular painting styles
                    of Rajasthan.</p>

                <h2> 1. Phad Paintings </h2>
                <p>Phad paintings are a seven hundred year old technique that has been passed down generation to
                    generation. Its origins are in Bhilwara, Rajasthan, Hence they are scroll paintings that narrate
                    elaborate stories about religion. And mainly about the deities the local population of a region
                    worships. They are widely recognised as “mobile temples” as phad artists would popularly travel with
                    their paintings. Also they narrate some story about the deity in the painting accompanied with
                    singing and dancing.
                    These Phads were used as traveling and portable temples of the local and Hindu folk deities. They
                    were carried along by the Bhopas, the priest-singers of the Rebari tribe in Rajasthan. They are
                    traditionally kept rolled while in transit. The Bhopas carry them and perform in front of them in
                    villages or towns and public places. They use it as a mobile temple and perform especially during
                    times of illness and misfortune. The Bhopas would unfold the Phad paintings after sunset and narrate
                    the stories of the epics and the deities throughout the night in the jagarans. The performance would
                    come to an end only in the early morning.
                    Along with this, the male priest (Bhopa) sings and narrates stories illustrated in the Phads. His
                    wife (Bhopi) holds an oil lamp putting light on the section of the Phad painting which is being
                    described. She also accompanies by singing some parts of the Phad and dancing. They also use a
                    two-string musical instrument in their performance known as a ‘ravanhatta’.

                <h2>2. Miniature Paintings</h2>
                <p>Many miniature painting artists today are known to have learnt this style from their older
                    generations in the family who worked as painters for the kings. However, this style was started in
                    the 16th century and what makes it stand out is the incredibly fine detailing and enchanting
                    narrative they portray. Another distinct feature about these paintings is that they are only
                    sometimes drawn on paper. Other times they are drawn on ivory! Because they are ‘miniature’ in size,
                    the brushes for creating these paintings require really fine bristles which are made from either a
                    few strands of a squirrel tail or from feathers of birds. Even today, only natural colours are used
                    for these paintings.
                    The Miniature painting of Rajasthan is an old art form known for its intricate painting and rich
                    colours. The first evidence of this art form exists in the form of illustration of old Buddhist
                    texts which were executed by the Palas of Northern India.
                    Simultaneously several other school of painting were set up in Mewar (Udaipur), Bundi, Kotah, Marwar
                    (Jodhpur), Bikaner, Jaipur, and Kishangarh.

                <p>Fairly recent compared to the rest of the painting styles, the gemstone paintings can only be traced
                    back to the last two hundred years. While there are cheaper -artificial stones – versions available
                    as well, the original version used semi precious stones instead of paint to add colour to the
                    painting. Since Rajasthan has always had a large repository of semi-precious gemstones like agate,
                    blood stone, amethyst, citrine, carnelian, jade, tiger, malachite, and others, this painting style
                    was almost bound to pop up. These semi precious stones are carefully selected, and grounded to a
                    paste to act as paint. They are then applied on marble or an acrylic or glass sheet.

                <p>Kajali is a less heard of ancient style of painting. It is more popular in the eastern parts of the
                    state. The word comes from ‘kajal’ which means carbon black. Apart from a grey colour, no other
                    shades of colour is incorporated into Kajali paintings. Hence, the interesting and most distinct
                    characteristic about this style is that no paintbrushes are incorporated in the process. Therefore,
                    the paintbrush is replaced with a hand and cloth. The kajali is obtained from the soot of the
                    burning oil lamps. The paper for this style is laminated with a cream base so the colour is absorbed
                    better.

                    walls of temples or behind the deity. These paintings are still done only with natural colours,
                    although the natural paintbrushes have been replaced with cheaper and artificial ones. While wealthy
                    families would purchase huge backdrops for their deity at home, lesser wealthy families would only
                    be able to afford smaller versions that would be placed beside their deity.

                    inspiration for gemstone painting style. But that stance is debated as this style is also just 200
                    years old. Hence, they are inherently relatively crowded paintings as they would depict elaborate
                    religious themes. Right from the ornamented temples and depictions of patrons and their families.
                    However they change to the names of the painters, these paintings included everything. They would
                    also employ a technique called Usta, wherein the painters would emboss gold and silver to enhance

                    hair. These paintings also have large panoramic backgrounds to add to the rest of the painting.

                    Purnima, Raas Leela and Anakoot, among others.
                    Among these varied styles of painting, one of the most popular and renowned styles of painting is
                    the Pichwai Paintings. The Pichwai Paintings are believed to have originated about four centuries
                    ago. It hails from the state of Rajasthan, more precisely from the Nathdwara town in the state. The
                    word “Pichh” means back, and the word “wai” translates to textile hanging. The Pichwai paintings
                    were usually hung behind the deity in the shrines of Srinathji. These paintings have an acute
                    attention to detail and were more intricate and detail-oriented than the traditional Phad paintings
                    from Rajasthan.

                    sacrifices. It is also very famous for its architectural monuments made of stone. Rajasthan is home
                    to temples, forts, palaces which have no competition.

                    Rajasthan’s rich reserve of diverse types of rocks is what attracts stone carvers to this place.
                    Special stones such as the sand stone, lime stone, coloured and white marbles are found here.

                    The architecture in Jaipur grew under the Rajputs. The marble and the sandstone are used in the City
                    Palace, Jantar Mantar ,Amer Fort, Hawa Mahal and Tripola gate in Jaipur. Jantar Mantar and Amer Fort
                    are world Heritage sites. These architectural master pieces have been instrumental in putting the
                    city in the world map. Jaipur forms part of the golden triangle, consisting of Delhi, Agra and
                    Jaipur. The Golden Triangle is called so because they are three most visited places in India.

                    Jhodpur is another city with palace like the Ummed Bhawan and Chittar Palace, forts made with red
                    sandstone. The perfect beauty and brilliance of the palaces will be bound to sweep you off your
                    feet.

                    The city of Jaisalmer is situated in the heart of the Thar Desert is called the ‘The Rose in the
                    Desert’ because of its red stone buildings. Places of interest include the Jaisalmer fort with its
                    massive sandstone walls which turn into a magical honey gold as the sun sets.

                    Dungarpur is the fastest growing city and was the first ODF free city in Rajasthan. This city has a
                    soft shaded stone which when oiled turns black. Places of interest include the Dev Somnath Temple. A
                    sprawling temple, it is known for its architectural design and intricate details.

                    Jaipur is also known for its marble carving. The centres of Ajmer, Udaipur and Bikaner are known for
                    their ‘jali’ work or lattices worked on screens in palaces.

                    Today, stone carvers have built up a industry of idol and sculpture making. This industry lies
                    mainly in the southwest region of Jaipur. The pieces not only include gods and goddesses but also
                    sculpture of animals, human figures and various geometric forms. The sculptures are crafted
                    beautifully and made with such beautiful details. The sculptures seem to have a soul that the
                    carvers seem to have put in them when they were making their masterpieces. This part of India is one
                    you absolutely cannot miss.

                <h2>Architecture</h2>
                <p>Rajasthan, India’s largest state, is well known for its historically significant monuments. Having an
                    incredible number of exquisite forts, palaces, and temples scattered throughout the state,
                    majestically emerging from the desert terrain at the top of hills, facing lakes resembling
                    fairy-tale-like castles. It has a rich cultural legacy, including artistic and cultural traditions
                    that reflect the early Hindu way of life. Rajasthani architecture encompasses a wide range of
                    structures, classified as secular or religious. The scales of these structures vary. Towns,
                    villages, wells, gardens, mansions, and palaces are among them.
                    Rajput architects created prominent architectural styles that may be found in towns such as
                    Jaisalmer, Udaipur, Jaipur, and Jodhpur. Jantar Mantar, Dilwara Temples, Lake Palace Hotel, City
                    Palaces, Chittorgarh Fort, and Jaisalmer Havelis are among Rajasthan’s most significant
                    architectural creations.

                <h2>1. Haveli</h2>
                <p>Marwaris built large estates known as Havelis in the Shekhawati and Marwar area between 1830s to
                    1930s. The Havelis were adorned with magnificent and attractive paintings and were surrounded on all
                    sides by a single huge entrance gate. In isolation from the outer world, this gave protection and
                    comfort. Later on, the broad word Haveli referred to business buildings and commercial residences.
                    Haveli’s architectural design has evolved in response to climate, lifestyle, and material
                    availability. Buildings with inner porches were thought to be the most ideal in hot areas when
                    refreshment is required. It served as an excellent cooling strategy while also enabling light to
                    enter.

                <h2>2. Courtyards of Haveli </h2>
                <p>Traditional South Asian buildings with courtyards are created according to ancient Vastu shastra
                    principles, which assert that all areas radiate from a single point, the house’s core. Yards are a
                    prevalent architectural element in South Asian architecture. Traditional South Asian homes are
                    designed around the yard, and all family activities take place in the chowk or yard.
                    The Chowk occasionally separated the spaces for men and ladies to give them better privacy.
                    Addressing the empty spaces in the building’s design to respond to the local climate. The natural
                    ventilation of the building was utilized to circulate air induced by temperature variations. During
                    the day, mostly women use the yard to accomplish their work and communicate with other women in
                    secluded uncovered locations. There was more than one yard in commercial class apartments. Baked
                    bricks, sandstone, marble, wood, stucco, and granite were commonly used materials. Local cultures
                    and traditions have an influence on decorative features.
