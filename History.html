                <p>Rajasthan, state of northwestern India,
                    located in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.
                    The capital city is Jaipur, in the east-central part of the state.

                    The capital city is Jaipur, in the east-central part of the state.
                    <b> Rajasthan ‘Land of Kings’ or ‘Land of Kingdom’ is India’s largest state by area. </b>The state
                    located on northwest part of country and is a home of cultural diversity.
                    Its features include the ruins of <b>Indus Valley Civilization, Temples, Forts and Fortresses in
                        almost every city.</b>
                    <b> Area 132,139 square miles (342,239 square km). Pop. (2011) 68,621,012.</b>

                    It is bounded to the north and northeast by the states of Punjab and Haryana, to the east and
                    southeast by
                    the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, to the southwest by the state of Gujarat, and to the
                    west
                    and northwest by the provinces of Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan.

                    <b> A world heritage site, Keoladeo National Park near Bharatpur, known for its bird life. Apart

                        Madhopur and Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar.</b>

                    The State was formed on 30th March 1949 when Rajputana – name as adopted by British Crown was merged
                    into the Dominion of India. Jaipur being largest city was declared as capital of the state.

                    The early history of Rajasthan includes some of the great Maharanas, Nawabs and Rulers. Prominent
                    among them were Prithiviraj Chouhan, Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya (also known as Hemu),Maharana
                    Udai Singh, Maharana Pratap, Raja Maan Singh and others.

                    Rajasthan’s formerly independent kingdoms developed a rich architectural and cultural heritage.

                <p>
                    The Aravalli (Aravali) Range forms a line across the state running roughly from
                    Guru Peak on <b>Mount Abu (5,650 feet [1,722 metres]), near the town of Abu in the
                        southwest, to the town of Khetri in the northeast. </b>About three-fifths of the
                    state lies northwest of that line, leaving the remaining two-fifths in the southeast.
                    <b>Those are the two natural divisions of Rajasthan. </b>
                    The northwestern tract is generally arid and unproductive,
                    although its character shifts gradually from desert in the far <b>west and northwest
                        to comparatively fertile and habitable land toward the east. The region includes
                        the Thar (Great Indian) Desert.</b>

                    The southeastern area lies at a somewhat higher elevation
                    (330 to 1,150 feet [100 to 350 metres]) than its northwestern counterpart;
                    it also is more fertile and has a more-diverse topography.
                    <b> The hilly tract of Mewar lies in the southern region,
                        while a broad plateau stretches across the southeast. </b>
                    In the northeast a <b>rugged badlands region follows the line of the Chambal River.
                        Farther north, the landscape levels</b> out into flat plains that are <b>part of the
                        alluvial basin of the Yamuna River.</b>
                    The Aravallis form Rajasthan’s most-important watershed. To the east of the range,
                    the Chambal River—the only large and perennial stream in the state—and other waterways
                    generally drain toward the northeast.<b> The principal tributary of the Chambal, the Banas River,
                        rises in the Aravallis near the great Kumbhalgarh hill fort and collects all the drainage of the
                        Mewar plateau.</b>
                    Farther north, the Banganga, after rising near Jaipur, flows east toward the Yamuna before
                    disappearing.
                    The Luni is the only significant river west of the Aravallis. It rises near the city of Ajmer
                    in central Rajasthan and flows some 200 miles (320 km) west-southwest into the Rann of Kachchh in
                    Gujarat state.
                    <b> Northeast of the Luni basin is an area of internal drainage characterized by salt lakes,
                        the largest of which is Sambhar Salt Lake.</b>
                    Farther to the west lies the true Marusthali <b>(“Land of the Dead”)</b>,
                    the barren <b>wastelands and areas of sand dunes that form the heart of the Thar Desert.

                    In the vast, sandy, and arid northwestern region, soils are predominantly saline or alkaline. Water
                    is scarce but is found at a depth of 100 to 200 feet (30 to 60 metres). The soil and sand are
                    calcareous (chalky). Nitrates in the soil increase its fertility,
                    and cultivation is often possible where adequate water supplies are made available.
                    The soils in central Rajasthan are also sandy; clay content varies between 3 and 9 percent. In the
                    east the soils vary from sandy loam to loamy sand. In the southeast they are in general black and
                    deep and are well drained. In the south-central region the tendency is toward a mixture of red
                    and black soils in the east and a range of red to yellow soils in the west.

                <h1>Climate</h1>
                <p>Rajasthan has a wide range of climate that varies from extremely arid to humid. The humid zone spans
                    the
                    southeast and east. Except in the hills, the heat during the summer is intense everywhere, with
                    temperatures
                    in June—the warmest month—typically rising from the mid-80s F (about 30 °C) to nearly 110 °F (low
                    40s C) daily.
                    Hot winds and dust storms occur in the summer, especially in the desert tract. In January—the
                    coolest of the
                    winter months—daily maximum temperatures range from the upper 60s to the mid-70s F (low to mid-20s
                    C),
                    while minimum temperatures are generally in the mid-40s F (about 7 °C). The western desert has
                    little rain,
                    averaging about 4 inches (100 mm) annually. In the southeast, however, some areas may receive almost
                    20 inches
                    (500 mm). Southeastern Rajasthan benefits from both the Arabian
                    Sea and Bay of Bengal branches of the southwest (summer) monsoon winds, which bring the bulk of the
                    annual
                    rainfall.</p>

                <h1>Plant and animal life</h1>
                <p>The predominant vegetation of Rajasthan is scrub jungle. Toward the west there are typical arid-zone
                    plants, such as tamarisk (genus Tamarix) and false tamarisk (genus Myricaria). Trees are scarce,
                    limited mostly to small, scattered forest areas in the Aravallis and in the eastern part of the
                    state. Less than 10 percent of Rajasthan is under forest cover.

                    A number of notable large mammals are regular residents of Rajasthan. Tigers are found primarily in
                    the Aravallis. Leopards, sloth bears, Indian sambar (dark brown Indian deer), and chital (spotted
                    deer) occur in the hills and forests. Nilgais (bluebucks; large antelope) are also found in parts,
                    and blackbucks are numerous in the plains. Common birds include snipes, quail, partridges, and wild
                    ducks; they occur everywhere except in the desert. The northwestern part of the state is well known
                    for several species of sandgrouse.

                    Numerous sanctuaries and wildlife parks have been established in the state. Among the most important
                    of those are Sariska National Park (established 1955), near Alwar in the northeast; Desert National
                    Park (1980), near Jaisalmer in western Rajasthan; and Keoladeo Ghana National Park (1981), in the
                    eastern part of the state near Bharatpur—the latter designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985

                <h1>
                    People of Rajasthan
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Most of Rajasthan’s population consists of Indians of various social, occupational, and religious
                    backgrounds. The Rajputs (various clans of landowning rulers and their descendants), though
                    representing only a small percentage of Rajasthan’s residents, are perhaps the most-notable section
                    of the population; indeed, the state draws its name from that community. In terms of caste
                    structure, the Brahmans (highest caste) are subdivided into many gotras (lineages), while the
                    Mahajans (trading caste) are subdivided into a bewildering number of groups. In the north and west
                    the Jats (peasant caste) and Gujars (herding caste) are among the largest agricultural communities.
                    Aboriginal (tribal) peoples constitute more than one-tenth of the population of Rajasthan. In the
                    eastern part of the state, those groups include the Mina (and the related Meo), most of whom are
                    farmers; the Banjara, who have been known as traveling traders and artisans; and the Gadia Lohar,
                    another historically itinerant tribe, who traditionally have made and repaired agricultural and
                    household implements. The Bhil, one of the oldest communities in India, generally inhabit southern
                    Rajasthan and have a history of possessing great skill in archery. The Grasia and Kathodi also
                    largely live in the south, mostly in the Mewar region.
                    Sahariya communities are found in the southeast, and the Rabari, who traditionally are cattle
                    breeders, live to the west of the Aravallis in west-central Rajasthan.

                    Hindi is the official language of the state, and to some degree it has overshadowed the local
                    languages of Rajasthan. Much of the state’s population, however, continues to speak Rajasthani
                    languages, which comprise a group of Indo-Aryan languages and dialects derived from Dingal, a tongue
                    in which bards once sang of the glories of their masters. The four main Rajasthani language groups
                    are Marwari in western Rajasthan, Jaipuri or Dhundhari in the east and southeast, Malvi in the
                    southeast, and in the northeast Mewati, which shades off into Braj Bhasa (a Hindi dialect) toward
                    the border with Uttar Pradesh.
                    Hinduism, the religion of the vast majority of the population, is generally practiced through the

                <h1>Economy</h1>
                <p>The agricultural sector has long been the mainstay of Rajasthan’s economy. It accounts for about
                    one-fourth of the state’s economic output, employing about two-thirds of the state’s working
                    population. Despite scant and scattered rainfall, nearly all types of crops are grown, including
                    pearl millet in the desert area, sorghum around Kota, and mainly corn (maize) around Udaipur. Wheat
                    and barley are fairly well distributed (except in the desert area), as are pulses (such as peas,
                    beans, and lentils), sugarcane, and oilseeds. Rice is grown in the irrigated areas of both the
                    southeast and the northwest. Cotton and tobacco are important cash crops. Rajasthan has a large
                    livestock
                    population and is a major wool-producing state. It also is a source of camels and draft animals of
                    various breeds.

                <h1>Traditional Dress for Rajasthani Women</h1>
                <p>The conventional attire that the women of Rajasthan wear comprises the long exuberant skirt called
                    Ghagra. The top garment is called Choli or Kurti. Along with this, they also cover their head or
                    drape around their shoulders the long, light fabric called Odani.<br>
                    The Ghagra has gorgeous embroidery, is full-length, and pleated. Usually made of silk, cotton,
                    crêpe, or georgette, it is available in a variety of bright colors and intricate patterns. The most
                    predominant style of printing techniques is the Bandhej, Laharia, Tie-and-Dye, Mothra, and Chundri.
                    The ghagra often has flourishing borders and Gota-Patti work which impart a regal elegance to the
                    garment.
                    <br> The Choli, Kurti, or Kanchli are equally elaborately styled, as per the requirements of the
                    wearer. Mirror-work into the embroidery adds an attractive quality. Especially when teamed with
                    beads, sequins, and coral shells. All such decorations embellish the garment with the signature of
                    its ethnic originality.
                    <br> The comfortable veil of Odani, or Chunar, protects the scorching climate of the desert. It is
                    approximately 2.5 meters long and 1.5 meters wide. It is often embroidered with beautiful designs,
                    prints, and beadwork. The woman wears it as what suits her. The traditional style is to tuck one
                    corner into the ghagra, while the rest is taken across the chest and draped over the shoulder or
                    over the head.
                    She gorgeous traditional accessories include the long necklaces known as Raani Haar, the Jadau sets,
                    and the Aad choker. Maang Tika or Borla and pearl Bangadi or bangles are worn widely. Tribal women
                    of Bhul, Meena, and Garasia communities wear ornaments made of brass and silver. Kaanbali
                    (earrings), Bajubandh (armlets), Nathani (nosepin), Kardhani (waist-chains), and Bichuwa (toe-rings)
                    also form important parts of the ensemble.

                <h1>Traditional Dress of Rajasthani Men</h1>
                <p>The customary attire for the Rajasthani man is the Dhoti, Angarkha, Kurta, and Pyjama. The Dhoti,
                    prevalent across most Indian states, is a long, white cloth, usually of cotton, draped around the
                    waist and tucked between the legs. The Angarkha is a robe-like garment worn along with Dhoti,
                    generally by men of affluent social status. Tribal communities have adapted the attire into their
                    traditional costume, reserving it for festivities and occasions. The Rajput clan wears the long,
                    ankle-length Angarkha. The Puthia, or Angarkhi, is worn for daily use. It is shorter in length and
                    the garment is fitted with the help of laces.<br>
                    The comfortable cotton Pyjamas are a loosely fitted set of pants, worn with Kurta or Mufti as the
                    upper garment. Traditionally, the Kurta is supposed to be knee-length. However, the modern style and
                    design patterns of the garment vary.<br>

                <h1>Pagari in Rajasthan</h1>
                <p>Pagari is a mark of cultural prestige among the Rajasthani men. The cloth of the Pagari is two meters
                    in length and about one-fifth meters in width. The style of wearing the Pagari differs according to
                    caste and region. The Safas are specially designed Pagaris which are worn for special occasions,
                    like weddings, and festivals. They are shorter and broader in size and more luxurious than regular
                    Pagaris.
                    The men also accessories themselves with traditional ornaments. Large bangle-like Balis, ear-studs,
                    and necklaces with crystal beads or semi-precious stones are the customary accessories. Men
                    belonging to families from the higher social strata wear waistbands called Kamarbandh and the Patka.
                    It is a piece of cloth placed over the shoulder.
                    Turbans worn in Rajasthan are referred to as the pagari. They vary in style, colour and size. They
                    also indicate a wearer's social class, caste, region and the occasion it being worn for. Its shape
                    and size may also vary with the climatic conditions of the different regions. Turbans in the hot
                    desert areas are large and loose. Farmers and shepherds, who need constant protection from the
                    elements of nature, wear some of the biggest turbans. The Rajasthani turban also has many practical
                    functions. Exhausted travellers use it as a pillow, a blanket or a towel. It can be used to strain
                    muddy water. An unravelled turban can also be used as a rope to draw water from a well with a
                    bucket.[6]

                    Prominent styles are pencha, sela and safa, although several local variants exist. A conventional
                    pagari is usually 82 inches long and 8 inches wide. A Safa is shorter and broader. Ordinarily a
                    turban of a single colour is worn. However, turbans of one of more colours may be worn by the elite
                    or during special occasions such as festivals or weddings, etc. Rajasthani turbans are a prominent
                    tourist attraction. Tourists are often encouraged to participate in turban-tying competitions.

                <h1>Footwear in Rajasthan</h1>
                <p>The traditional footwear of the Rajasthani people is the Juttis or Mojari. These are leather shoes of
                    intricate embellishments and are made of camel, sheep, or goatskin. The traditional style of Jooti
                    is colored black or brown. In modern fashion, however, various multi-colored slip-on is also
                    prevalent.

                    The costumes of Rajasthan form a brilliant and vibrant ensemble that forms an important part of the
                    identity of a rich heritage. The people, thus, take pride in upholding their tradition.
                    <br> In the olden times, Mojaris (also known as Khussas) were the staple style statement of crème de
                    la crème of the society – the Nawabs, Maharajas and Zamindars. Recognised as the blingy variant of
                    the ballerina flats, hailing from Rajasthan, Mojaris are mainly crafted in the blue city Jodhpur,
                    pink city Jaipur and Punjab. At the time of their origin, Mojari were made using pure gold and
                    silver threads and embellished by rare pearls and precious jewels especially for the Royal Kings and
                    Queens. The prominent Sikh leaders Ranjeet and Sher Singh are also potrayed in miniature paintings
                    wearing khussas (Known as ‘Jodhpuri’ in Sikh community).
                    The extended curled toe, open look from the back and the grand swirling designs depict the touch of

                    From the lush green, prosperous and glorious Punjab and Rajasthan arrives the lovable Jutti which
                    has made their mark not only on the Northern India but across the whole world.The juttis were first
                    patronised by the Mughals, and were adored by the elite Maharajas and Maharanis who belonged to the
                    richest era of Indian history.

                <h1>Folk Dances & music of Rajasthan</h1>
                <p>Known for its rich cultural past, Rajasthan is the royal state of India. Tribal music or folk music
                    plays a key role in Rajasthani culture because tribal communities formerly had dominated the state.
                    The dances and accompanying music are ballad-like, tell epic stories and that of eternal love. There
                    are other songs of devotion, too. Rajasthan Dances are performed on numerous auspicious occasions
                    with the purpose of expressing happiness among themselves, as well as telling stories in a unique
                    and enticing style. The emergence of princely states during medieval times also led to the evolution
                    of folk dances, since the monarchs patronised different art and crafts. Each region has its own type
                    and style of folk entertainment with diverse dances and songs since rulers from several cultures
                    ruled the Rajasthan. It’s vivid, powerful and highly captivating. Here are various Rajasthani folk

                <p>Rajasthan is mainly a traditional folk dance performed by ladies of the State Tribal Communities of
                    Kalbelia, Jat, Meena, Bhil or Kumhar. It takes many years that the dance takes ladies who balance
                    8-9 pots or brass pitchers on the head while dancing and twisting on the side of a glass or brass
                    plate with their feet (sometimes even the edge of a sword). The graciously twisting movements of
                    ladies paired with the balancing show their difficulties in society. The dance form is paired with
                    male singers and instruments like the harmonium, sarangi and dholak. During significant occasions
                    and festivals, experts perform this dance genre. Since some respected hotels provide a closer

                    is performed on different traditional instruments, while dancers swing their arms to loud drums in a
                    clock-wise and anticlockwise way. At each turn the dancers fall in, beat their stick, while the song
                    is accompanied by a repetitive rhythmic thump of the drums. In the Mewar region, this dance type is
                    performed. However, its varieties such as the Dandi Gair and the Geendad also exist in Marwar and

                    high and constructed in Sawai-Madhopur, Bari and Udaipur. The puppets are controlled and manoeuvred
                    by strings on the limbs of the puppeteers. These people are also vocalists who give a special
                    flavour to Kathputli dancing as they sing stories from Indian culture and mythology. Some of them
                    also deal with current social challenges. Shadipur depot in New Delhi is the Kathputli Colony

                <h2>8. Chakri Dance</h2>
                <p>The word “Chakri” denotes a circle, as the name implies. It is a popular folk dance of Kanjar in
                    several parts of Kota and Rajasthan district. It is usually done in groups of women. The dance shows
                    the circular movement of dancers on their knees, who twist in circles. Dancers wear beautiful skirts
                    with tons of traditional Rajasthani mirror work and the entire group looks radiant and colourful as
                    they carry out the dance. The Chakri draws its name from Chakra which means the wheel, and it goes
                    to indicate how quickly women move about when they spin like swift wheels. They cover a wide space
                    as they continue to move without clashing with each other and still move around the group with much
                    expertise. The music is quite important here because the dance is so rapid and agile. The women also
                    sing when they dance to support the quick rhythm of the instruments. The music begins gently and
                    continues to reach the height with the development of the dance. Nagara and the dholak are two major
                    instruments played as accompaniments to the dance of Chakri. The Nagara is an instrument like a
                    drum, and the beats are hard and loud, and they are the best music to play at a high level of energy
                    for the performance. Dholak is another drum-like instrument, producing wonderful and lively music as
                    well. Men play the Dholak or Nagara in most cases to support the women of their clans.</p>

                    remains the cuisine of the state of Rajasthan. The state is known for its snacks that we enjoy every
                    evening with the Lushun ki chutney, which is yet another gift given to us by this great state. Apart
                    from that, the intense appetizers, spicy dishes, and sabzis as well as how can one forget my
                    favorite part of the meal that is desserts, will surely get you drooling. Rajasthani dishes are the
                    red chilies that are added to avoid the loss of water but enhance the taste anyway. Here is a list

                    traditional meat curry is made using varied ingredients such as of course, meat, in a thick gravy of
                    yogurt and countless spices but to give it its signature spicy element are the Mathania red chilies.
                    It is typically served along with bajra rotis and is a crown jewel of the Rajasthani Cuisine. Its

                    preparation varies from region to regions such as the aromatic Masala Gatte and Shai Gatte, which is
                    aptly named, to say the least. The Gatte which are ground flour dumplings, taste scrumptious in the
                    hot gravy which is composed of mainly yogurt, and of course, it wouldn’t be a Rajasthani dish,
                    without adding in a complete variety of spices.</p>

                <h2>1. Bandhani Fabric </h2>
                <p>The Rajasthani precise design cloth work is famous in the whole world. The Bandhini textile is famous
                    for such work. Historical records suggest that the earliest examples of Bandhani date back to 4000
                    BCE. The Bandhani textile got its name because of the knots (Bandhan) on the cloth during dying. The
                    weavers intentionally leave the knot even after dying the fabric, which has become a Bandhani
                    Textile symbol.

                    This print is in practice in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh as well. This fine textile work is in demand
                    in the entire country. The designs include red, yellow, saffron, maroon, and black motifs.
                    The symbolism attached to this is multitude and goes hand in hand with the colour depiction. For
                    instance, a red cloth designed with Bandhani printing increases the beauty of a Hindu Bride. Another
                    example might be the representation of maternity via yellow Bandhani cloth.

                    Chandrakala, BavanBaug and Shikari are some of the patterns on the Bandhani fabric. The Khatri
                    community is the parent community that is responsible for the development of the Bandhani style.

                <h2>2. Leheriya Fabric</h2>
                <p>The term ‘Leheriya’ derives its origin from the work ‘Leher’, meaning wave. The name accurately
                    describes the textile. The Leheriya work focuses on clear and sober pattern designs created on thin
                    cotton or silk cloth. This is predominantly famous for turbans, saris, and chunnis.

                    The Leheria turbans were a fashion statement in the 19th-20th centuries. Every one out of five men
                    in India wore a Leheria turban to show off their fashion sense. The Leheria textile industry got
                    fame for its zig-zag patterns and vibrant colour palette. The print is still in practice in
                    Nathwada, Jaipur, Udaipur, and Jodhpur.

                <h2>3. Bagru Fabric</h2>
                <p>The artists who work on the Bagru textile focus more on floral design printing, and they use natural
                    vegetable colours for printing. The Chippa community of Rajasthan extensively practises the Bagru
                    print.

                    The Bagra print originally belongs to the textile industry of Gujarat. It travelled with the chippa
                    community when they migrated to the deserts of Rajasthan from the Gujarati mainlands in the 17th
                    century. The weavers work on Indigo or blue-coloured cloth stylization to enhance the beauty of the
                    product.

                    Seyali Bagru is a type of Bagru print that involves the provocative use of yellow ochre and black
                    hues.

                <h2>4. Kota Doria Fabric </h2>
                <p>Kota Doria, as the name suggests, is a textile industry based in Kota. The checkered square patterns
                    are the speciality of the Kota Doria Cloth. The pure cotton or silk fabric is extremely lightweight,
                    and the use of check patterns is a unique lucrative method.

                    The style has roots in the textile style of Mysore. A Mughal army general, Rao Kishore, enlisted and
                    brought some weavers from Mysore, and this became the beginning of the style in Rajasthan. For this
                    reason, Kota Doria was called Kota Masuria in its initial days. The weavers often apply a mixture of
                    onion juice and rice paste while weaving the cloth, and the application of this mixture ensures
                    cloth durability.

                    Kaithloon, present near Kota, is insanely famous for Kota Doria sarees. Although machines are in
                    predominant use today, small handloom weavers got employment due to this textile industry. Not to
                    mention, the emotional strings attached to the handmade Kota Doria is absent in the machine-made
                    sarees.

                <h2>5. Barmeri Prints </h2>
                <p>The geometric prints of the cloth make the Barmeri textile unique. The Barmeri has to offer a lot
                    that does not resemble the typical Rajasthani textile. For instance, unlike the light floral colours
                    used in most textile works, Barmeri is famous for its dark shades. Based in the Thar desert, the
                    locals prefer darker colour tones as dark shades are cooler.

                    This famous textile of Rajasthan belongs to the Sindh region, and these prints originally belong to
                    the Sindhi Muslims. However, the art spread across the country along with cultural and trend shifts.

                    The Barmeri print often dwells on topics or themes like plants, animals, birds, and nature. The
                    bright and vibrant dyes used involve primary colours like red, yellow, indigo, etc.

                <h2>6. Sanganeri Fabric </h2>
                <p>Sangneri is one of the most famous textiles in Rajasthan. ‘A hub of block and screen printing in
                    Rajasthan’ is what we call it. The illustrious folk patterns on the white cotton give it a
                    traditional essence. Sangneri is famous for making tablecloths, home linens, bed covers, etc. The
                    folk motifs printed on the cloth also have black outlines which enhance the beauty of the fabric.
                    Figures and flower patterns use red dye to attract customers.

                    The Sangneri bloomed with the British invasion of India, and the European settlers exported large
                    quantities of Sangneri to Europe. Sangner in the pink city, Jaipur, is the originator of the style.
                    Wooden block printing is the core method in use, and Calico printing is the other name by which we
                    often call the Sanganeri block prints.

                    The most famous motifs include that of lotus flower, roses, sunflower, lily, etc. The initial
                    weavers used natural dyes only. However, chemical colours or dyes are no surprise wing to the stark
                    rise in demand and less staff.

                <p>An interesting fact about the Mothra Print- theMothraprint got its name from the Moth Dal. The
                   Mothra print is an ever-flourishing tie and dye technique of Rajasthan with checkered patterns
                    printed on the cloth with interspersed undyed areas.

                    Rajasthan is among the best places to visit in the entire world. The earthly yet world-class
                    cultural embellishments are exclusive to Rajasthan. As a traveller, it is virtually impossible to
                    ‘keep your hands to yourself’ when you see alluring textile and handlooms everywhere you go. The
                    modern-day textile industry mainly relies on machines. However, the actual textile of Rajasthan lies
                    preserved in the handmade textile only. Although the hands of the weaver tremble, the essence and
                    beauty of the fabric are still intact.

                <h2> 1. Phad Paintings </h2>
                <p>Phad paintings are a seven hundred year old technique that has been passed down generation to
                    generation. Its origins are in Bhilwara, Rajasthan, Hence they are scroll paintings that narrate
                    elaborate stories about religion. And mainly about the deities the local population of a region
                    worships. They are widely recognised as “mobile temples” as phad artists would popularly travel with
                    their paintings. Also they narrate some story about the deity in the painting accompanied with
                    singing and dancing.
                    These Phads were used as traveling and portable temples of the local and Hindu folk deities. They
                    were carried along by the Bhopas, the priest-singers of the Rebari tribe in Rajasthan. They are
                    traditionally kept rolled while in transit. The Bhopas carry them and perform in front of them in
                    villages or towns and public places. They use it as a mobile temple and perform especially during
                    times of illness and misfortune. The Bhopas would unfold the Phad paintings after sunset and narrate
                    the stories of the epics and the deities throughout the night in the jagarans. The performance would
                    come to an end only in the early morning.
                    Along with this, the male priest (Bhopa) sings and narrates stories illustrated in the Phads. His
                    wife (Bhopi) holds an oil lamp putting light on the section of the Phad painting which is being
                    described. She also accompanies by singing some parts of the Phad and dancing. They also use a
                    two-string musical instrument in their performance known as a ‘ravanhatta’.

                <h2>2. Miniature Paintings</h2>
                <p>Many miniature painting artists today are known to have learnt this style from their older
                    generations in the family who worked as painters for the kings. However, this style was started in
                    the 16th century and what makes it stand out is the incredibly fine detailing and enchanting
                    narrative they portray. Another distinct feature about these paintings is that they are only
                    sometimes drawn on paper. Other times they are drawn on ivory! Because they are ‘miniature’ in size,
                    the brushes for creating these paintings require really fine bristles which are made from either a
                    few strands of a squirrel tail or from feathers of birds. Even today, only natural colours are used
                    for these paintings.
                    The Miniature painting of Rajasthan is an old art form known for its intricate painting and rich
                    colours. The first evidence of this art form exists in the form of illustration of old Buddhist
                    texts which were executed by the Palas of Northern India.
                    Simultaneously several other school of painting were set up in Mewar (Udaipur), Bundi, Kotah, Marwar
                    (Jodhpur), Bikaner, Jaipur, and Kishangarh.

                <p>Fairly recent compared to the rest of the painting styles, the gemstone paintings can only be traced
                    back to the last two hundred years. While there are cheaper -artificial stones – versions available
                    as well, the original version used semi precious stones instead of paint to add colour to the
                    painting. Since Rajasthan has always had a large repository of semi-precious gemstones like agate,
                    blood stone, amethyst, citrine, carnelian, jade, tiger, malachite, and others, this painting style
                    was almost bound to pop up. These semi precious stones are carefully selected, and grounded to a
                    paste to act as paint. They are then applied on marble or an acrylic or glass sheet.

                <p>Kajali is a less heard of ancient style of painting. It is more popular in the eastern parts of the
                    state. The word comes from ‘kajal’ which means carbon black. Apart from a grey colour, no other
                    shades of colour is incorporated into Kajali paintings. Hence, the interesting and most distinct
                    characteristic about this style is that no paintbrushes are incorporated in the process. Therefore,
                    the paintbrush is replaced with a hand and cloth. The kajali is obtained from the soot of the
                    burning oil lamps. The paper for this style is laminated with a cream base so the colour is absorbed
                    better.

                    walls of temples or behind the deity. These paintings are still done only with natural colours,
                    although the natural paintbrushes have been replaced with cheaper and artificial ones. While wealthy
                    families would purchase huge backdrops for their deity at home, lesser wealthy families would only
                    be able to afford smaller versions that would be placed beside their deity.

                    inspiration for gemstone painting style. But that stance is debated as this style is also just 200
                    years old. Hence, they are inherently relatively crowded paintings as they would depict elaborate
                    religious themes. Right from the ornamented temples and depictions of patrons and their families.
                    However they change to the names of the painters, these paintings included everything. They would

                    and is practised only by a select few. To create a Sanjhi design, stencils are created by hand and

                <h2>10. Pichwai Paintings</h2>
                <p>The Pichwai art tradition has been passed through generations in a quite sacred manner. The painting
                    is not taught in an educational institution but is learned under the guidance of a master artist. To
                    this day, this is the practice adopted to master this art.

                    The mesmerizing Pichwai paintings portray Lord Krishna as Shrinathji. Apart from Lord Krishna;
                    Radha, Gopis, and the images of lotuses, also have a prominent presence in the paintings. This
                    textile painting also depicts various Indian festivals such as Diwali, Janmashtami, Holi, Sharad
                    Purnima, Raas Leela and Anakoot, among others.
                    Among these varied styles of painting, one of the most popular and renowned styles of painting is
                    the Pichwai Paintings. The Pichwai Paintings are believed to have originated about four centuries
                    ago. It hails from the state of Rajasthan, more precisely from the Nathdwara town in the state. The
                    word “Pichh” means back, and the word “wai” translates to textile hanging. The Pichwai paintings
                    were usually hung behind the deity in the shrines of Srinathji. These paintings have an acute
                    attention to detail and were more intricate and detail-oriented than the traditional Phad paintings
                    from Rajasthan.

                <h1>Stone Caves</h1>
                <p>Rajasthan is a land of rich culture. It is famous for its heroes and their valorous deeds and
                    sacrifices. It is also very famous for its architectural monuments made of stone. Rajasthan is home
                    to temples, forts, palaces which have no competition.

                    Rajasthan’s rich reserve of diverse types of rocks is what attracts stone carvers to this place.
                    Special stones such as the sand stone, lime stone, coloured and white marbles are found here.

                    The architecture in Jaipur grew under the Rajputs. The marble and the sandstone are used in the City
                    Palace, Jantar Mantar ,Amer Fort, Hawa Mahal and Tripola gate in Jaipur. Jantar Mantar and Amer Fort
                    are world Heritage sites. These architectural master pieces have been instrumental in putting the
                    city in the world map. Jaipur forms part of the golden triangle, consisting of Delhi, Agra and
                    Jaipur. The Golden Triangle is called so because they are three most visited places in India.

                    Jhodpur is another city with palace like the Ummed Bhawan and Chittar Palace, forts made with red
                    sandstone. The perfect beauty and brilliance of the palaces will be bound to sweep you off your
                    feet.

                    The city of Jaisalmer is situated in the heart of the Thar Desert is called the ‘The Rose in the
                    Desert’ because of its red stone buildings. Places of interest include the Jaisalmer fort with its
                    massive sandstone walls which turn into a magical honey gold as the sun sets.

                    Dungarpur is the fastest growing city and was the first ODF free city in Rajasthan. This city has a
                    soft shaded stone which when oiled turns black. Places of interest include the Dev Somnath Temple. A
                    sprawling temple, it is known for its architectural design and intricate details.

                    Jaipur is also known for its marble carving. The centres of Ajmer, Udaipur and Bikaner are known for
                    their ‘jali’ work or lattices worked on screens in palaces.

                    Today, stone carvers have built up a industry of idol and sculpture making. This industry lies
                    mainly in the southwest region of Jaipur. The pieces not only include gods and goddesses but also
                    sculpture of animals, human figures and various geometric forms. The sculptures are crafted
                    beautifully and made with such beautiful details. The sculptures seem to have a soul that the
                    carvers seem to have put in them when they were making their masterpieces. This part of India is one
                    you absolutely cannot miss.

                <h1>Architecture</h1>
                <p>Rajasthan, India’s largest state, is well known for its historically significant monuments. Having an
                    incredible number of exquisite forts, palaces, and temples scattered throughout the state,
                    majestically emerging from the desert terrain at the top of hills, facing lakes resembling
                    fairy-tale-like castles. It has a rich cultural legacy, including artistic and cultural traditions
                    that reflect the early Hindu way of life. Rajasthani architecture encompasses a wide range of
                    structures, classified as secular or religious. The scales of these structures vary. Towns,
                    villages, wells, gardens, mansions, and palaces are among them.
                    Rajput architects created prominent architectural styles that may be found in towns such as
                    Jaisalmer, Udaipur, Jaipur, and Jodhpur. Jantar Mantar, Dilwara Temples, Lake Palace Hotel, City
                    Palaces, Chittorgarh Fort, and Jaisalmer Havelis are among Rajasthan’s most significant
                    architectural creations.

                <h2>1. Haveli</h2>
                <p>Marwaris built large estates known as Havelis in the Shekhawati and Marwar area between 1830s to
                    1930s. The Havelis were adorned with magnificent and attractive paintings and were surrounded on all
                    sides by a single huge entrance gate. In isolation from the outer world, this gave protection and
                    comfort. Later on, the broad word Haveli referred to business buildings and commercial residences.
                    Haveli’s architectural design has evolved in response to climate, lifestyle, and material
                    availability. Buildings with inner porches were thought to be the most ideal in hot areas when
                    refreshment is required. It served as an excellent cooling strategy while also enabling light to
                    enter.

                <h2>2. Courtyards of Haveli </h2>
                <p>Traditional South Asian buildings with courtyards are created according to ancient Vastu shastra
                    principles, which assert that all areas radiate from a single point, the house’s core. Yards are a
                    prevalent architectural element in South Asian architecture. Traditional South Asian homes are
                    designed around the yard, and all family activities take place in the chowk or yard.
                    The Chowk occasionally separated the spaces for men and ladies to give them better privacy.
                    Addressing the empty spaces in the building’s design to respond to the local climate. The natural
                    ventilation of the building was utilized to circulate air induced by temperature variations. During
                    the day, mostly women use the yard to accomplish their work and communicate with other women in
                    secluded uncovered locations. There was more than one yard in commercial class apartments. Baked
                    bricks, sandstone, marble, wood, stucco, and granite were commonly used materials. Local cultures
                    and traditions have an influence on decorative features.
